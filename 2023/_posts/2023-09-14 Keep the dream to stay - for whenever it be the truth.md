Well I guess today is a good day. For real, it's kind of good for me. Not that much existential thoughts beside what the hell I am doing with my life not doing the thing I like and rather let myself being pulled down the deep hole of... shit. 
 Either way, let's begin.

### QOTD (Question of the day)
- What is the connection between complex differential geometry and deep learning?
- Local functions is called by using `let` expression in SML. This ensure the part where the function need to be stay private, to be like that. Also, it also help with compile time because the program does not need to load it as for global functions. But hey, what can you do to try accessing it from outside without a call from another method?

### TOTD (Thoughts of the day)
I hate university at one specific things: Sometimes the lecturer just throw in a bunch of shit and call it a day then tell us how tf we can get to uni with that kind of thing.
