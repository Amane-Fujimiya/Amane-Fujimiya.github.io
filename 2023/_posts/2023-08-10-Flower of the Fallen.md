Flower of the fallen. Once live the given life, now sleep in the land of mother nature. Some lives down there suffered more than the rest, some never fulfil their life. But for now, their deeds have ran out, forever in a peaceful sleep of life, never wake up. 

Enough of that talk though. Anyway. It seems like LK-99 has ran out of steam for the last few weeks. Pretty sad considering that the history of superconducting research is often like this - abrupt 'ground-breaking' discoveries, then everything is flushed into the deep hole of un-excitement. How awful. 

### QOTD (Question of the day)
- How life's created? Everything seems to be just molecule, if we are counting into it, the final thing is a big chunks of molecules stuck together, just like ourselves. Just how, everything stick together, and form a systematic way of interaction? What governs the interaction, what indeed set up for even more complex type of evolution? It seems to me that evolution is totally random, but maybe not. It seems to be a process of a lawless land, but somehow, it feels weird. It's not. So how? And what?
- How consciousness exists? We branded ourselves as being conscious, but what this conscious exactly mean? The ability to figure out ourselves, the thought process of us be able to recognize what is us, to know our purpose, to have such sense of curiosity?  What exactly is to be conscious. And, will consciousness appears beside what is meant to be, human?
- How in general, gravitational waves is created through to consumption of energy and masses? Aren't it a force of attractions, through the weight there by exists such force? Then, we gravitational forces come from, in real sense, of real origin?
### TOTD (Thought of the day)

Not much for a pretty boring day. At least that is for me. At least, that is for my life at the current stage. I am still very aware of what I am lacking. No, I do not mean that of just saying out to downgrade myself so that I fits the "genius type who know what he is lacking". I am seriously lacking a lot of things. A lot of knowledge. I am not matured enough. Not enough to see the world, not enough to gain the wisdom the fallen and the old adventurers of this world left. Many wisdom will be lost, for someone just like you and I who want to gather them all, I is an uneasy feeling.

Sometimes, I do wonder why people still take DNN as something quite rather forefront of AI. The takes that our brain works like a bunch of ordered networks with layers of 'weight' comes rather surprise to me. Well, at least it's mine alone. Still, at long at it is, I don't think we are going in the right direction. 

Our brain's neuron is not even similar in all senses. What we are doing is rather an over-simplification of neuron - logical operators of our brain to fits it with current hardware, knowledge and limits. Also, it kinda weird to me of the super-specialized parts of our AI for now. Similar to the old Synthetic AI, which has human-written algorithm as input for whenever an improvement is deemed necessary, for now, LLM and DNN do it automatically, but with huge influxes of "exercises" and wrong check. It does not come to far, or push us further that much if we look at the bigger picture. 

What I want to do, beside from just improving the neural system as a whole, DNN as a concept and paradigm, learning mechanism which related to what I want - recursive learning, and human neuroscience, is the distribution system. As with everything, even our brain is wired with different regions producing different result, responds with different inputs, and are wired all together. For me, a distribution system, a way for different network to communicate and figure results is more important.
