Well, then. Welcome to physics endeavour, my friend. We are finally in it!

Not to be too much happiness, but hey, one can dream, no? And when it becomes true, there are sensations of joyfulness that only the person who receive it can feel. 

Either way, it seems like today has no specific exploration or scientific research being done. I myself am still suffering from the lack of memory of derivative and integral formulas which I **really** hate to remember - it's feel so fake to do the reminisce.

### QOTD (Question of the day)

- First law of Newtonian physics is a statement that basically says inertial frame exists. But, inertial frame definition is written kind of, not so abstract, because it also depends on measurement with reference to another inertial frame. So which one is actually an "inertial frame"? 
- How different combination of a numbers of LED produces different kind of frame on the screen? 
- **Milankovitch cycles** say to us about Earth's climate cycles, which is at large the cycle of carbons and other life resource of our environment. So... why sometimes it was so spread out and sometimes, it did not?
- A sigmoid function is defined as $$\displaystyle \sigma (x)={\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}}}={\frac {e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}}=1-\sigma (-x)$$ which is itself a [[Logistic Function]] with a unique S shape. It is non-linear, thus might be sufficient to say that's why it is used in ML, but why? It might have something to do with fuzzy logics, since it does varied between $1$ and $-1$, allowing for negative passage result from the model, but what else? 
- Loop seems to not makes sense in functional programming. Most of the time, recursion is used because it is both natural, and indeed, quite spectacularly simple to implement, and offers a variety of solutions. Are there any others paradigm of functions? 
- Again, how the old computers with Vacuum tubes and punch cards can be used? It seems very impractical, somehow. 

### TOTD (Thoughts of the day)

Nein. We ain't got anything from here and now on.
