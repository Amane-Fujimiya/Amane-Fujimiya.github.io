So yeah, life is hard. Having sex without the worry of STD/STI? Nope, STDs are old as human goes. More than that, even. 

Anyway, trading seems to be pretty fun, with some concepts as money velocities, market escrow ratio, broker's fee evasion (not tax evasion$^{TM}$), and so on. Either way, it's only a side gigs as I will make my foot into physics, mathematics and computer sciences, especially AI development (who knows, I'm quite interested in it, because I hate diseases). 

Either way, let's go a routine. 

### QOTD (Question of the day)

- Why in mathematics, function is hard to consume? For example, many people misunderstand imaging, relations to functions as its meaning. A function $f(x)$ is said to be a proper function if it is either bijective, surjective, or injective. Otherwise, for many $x$ to many $y$ and two $x$ for an $y$ is not called a proper function. It is rather called a relation $g: A \longrightarrow B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$. It seems like this is misunderstood a lot. 
- Quantum Physics is weird, in the sense that it's the approximation that is legit. As we all concern of, quantum physics deals with uncertainty and measurements, thus by far, it is downright pretty much in line with the practicality of physics - that is, the are no ideal structure in real life, most of them won't be able to manifest in reality that long for us to observe, or simply "too good to be true". 
- Everything is a measurement, everything is some conventions. So what will quantum physics and overall the scientific measurement of modern time tell us? 
- From the question above, one will need to wonder, what is "stop"? All things, motions and states are measured by relationships. A spacecraft might be called stable and stationary from an observer, but not so from another one. Even then, your relative speed might not be stationary if you are accounting in something that all round over, make you realise that you are always "moving" instead of being in a stop state. So, again, how do we stop? 

Some self-question: 
- I want to represent and imagine the 4th dimension. For now, it is too complicated to imagine such things of unusual spatial relativity and spaces. Well, so this begs the question: can I visual it as mathematical equations and mapping?
- A lot of time Einstein's relativity is badly represented, or being oversimplified. A mat hanging and a ball letting it being pushed down, like a hole? Wait, are you ignoring the whole 3d spaces? Where's the hole if I am going downward from the Southern Hemisphere (I feel bad for them lol)? 
- Let's make something that can lead us to multi-dimensional world, or best, heck, to have multiverse a reality. If there are none, make it, shall we?

### TOTD (Thought of the day)

Again, I have not that much thing to think about.

Maybe it will be something as if there are any afterlife, of which we do not think there are. 

Of others, it will just be the focus on what I am studying, for example, computer sciences, then the formal definition of function, as well as how many variable can be inputted in to the function. Seriously though, some course and teachers misrepresented the thing, making the student think that a function is indeed can be any type of value it can be, which, make the program very vulnerable to errors, and the logic is so tangled that I do not think someone will be able to manage it. In short, it is this: There are no data types that is general for functions, and it evaluates from all the variables inside. Which seems weird, because if all m variables do are inputting two different type of variables, and it somehow biased to present one type instead of the others (for example, you add and `int` and a `float`, but the floating point is gone because the function choose the data type `int` instead). 

For others, there are not so much thought. Tend to go easy and live the life, ain't you?
