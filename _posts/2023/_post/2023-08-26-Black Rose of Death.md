I'm thinking of doing an QOTM - Question of the Month to recap every thoughts I had each months. Perhaps? That's quite an organizable stuff that I can handle. Either way, also put into the to-do-list that I have to do some re-organization too. 

### QOTD (Question of the Day)

- If lights is bended by gravity, then what is exactly the "shape" of that region of space that lights being bended in? 
- Suppose you have a prediction. Let say, guess a number from $1-10$. Then give it to a sample of 1000 normal persons, and another one of 100 professional statistician. What will be the accuracy of each sample, and what is the deviation? 
- Why $e$ is everywhere? From sigmoid function to logistic functions, it's everywhere. That does not include hyperbolic functions, compound interests, normal distribution, et cetera. Why the number $e$ is so prominent? 
- Are we existing to not exist anymore?

### TOTD (Thought of the day)

Nothing. A void. Like the black rose of death, pitch black.
