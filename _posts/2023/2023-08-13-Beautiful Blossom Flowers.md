It's a beautiful day, today. Of the song that sang of winters, of the happiness rarely hides itself in those flowers' petals. My life, of which I do not proud of being full of happy memories, as one shall say about everyone's life, is a bit excessively happy for now. A sensation ones will forever endure everything to have it again. 

Again (no pun intended), back on track. We have nothing today since it's Sunday.
