Nanotechnology sounds fun. In fact, I think it has one of the most substantial potential of all 'futuristic' we might have in the near future. Even if we do not have total control to the gate of nano-scale application that much or widespread, it will be good to continue doing toward that direction, and further down to molecular/genetic engineering of our body. Of course, it is to help us out of diseases and infections. 

### QOTD (Question of the day)

- What is perhaps the most possible way to evaluate the black hole mass? We do not know the exact detail, all of what we have done are some approximation, and more. 
- In a sense of philosophical approach, what is the things that defines classical physics to be "wrong", while quantum physics is what is "right" and in fact the world is made of "quantum" systems?
- As for any others ground-breaking application and discovery, for superconductor, are those typically, ceramic-based, High-T superconductor that hard to find? Most of our superconductor are very weird, most of the time, they utilize a series of layering and molecular configuration that determine did the zero-waste transfer of energy in a system. Why this is so hard to do, and what comes, with the process of experiment?
- What if we have a distributed system of logical templates - library - logic processing - learning mechanism and a central command for an AI, that provide itself of self-learning and self-modification beside a certain moral standpoint or setting that is default to be impervious of entry, rather than just doing mindless "learning" model like the current day? But I have to admit Hentai ML model is good though (I'm kind of degenerated lol). 
- I have an idea for a chained, recursive type of learning. May that work in the future. 
- How is data organized in a way that we generally 'learn' from? Actually, how do we learn? 

### TOTD (Though of the day)

Nothing. I can think of nothing particularly good, except for some way to refute Yuval Noah Harari from is sensationalistic, pseudo-science generic position in his writing. Somehow, also, he is said to be a vegan. So it makes sense why he agrees on such grounds that wheat conquered human, eh? (Even though this assumption is factually wrong).
