Kabul 89'. The beginning of the end of an era, of the Cold War. To be honest, I kind of like the Cold War more. While it's the truth that there were many things terrible, like civil wars, proxy wars, and sort of, but the aesthetics are there to stay. The political talks, manoeuvre, the feeling of being at the centre of the world where two main superpowers resided. Ideological fights, religions breakdown. The society being more of a "direct" one, face-to-face. Best of all. In some way or another, there are miracle. There are hopes in a better future than ever, as with any beginning of a bigger era, a Re-Renaissance Era waiting. Of the country I lived, there are more positives, more hope for the young, and more happiness. Such a shame those days are gone, for now. May another era of prosperity emerge again, for humanity to live a peaceful life.

### QOTD (Question of the Day)
- What is the intention behind Yuval Noah Harari's sentence regarding human as the "oppressor, destructor, and selfish"? Isn't it the rule of nature for whatever to adapt first to gain everything, and for those who are more powerful to eat the small, to sustain themselves? 
- What is exactly "information"? in Quantum Physics, information are conserved, somehow, in theory. But everything surround information is so weird, because there are nothing for us to define it specifically good. 

### TOTD (Thought of the Day)

What is it? Quantum Entanglement? Relativity? I don't personally know. I consider myself being na√Øve there, not knowing the exact thing. But who will? 

Of QP, I do have something to ask for it: What do you mean that information is "shared" inside a wormhole? What does that actually mean?

Mental health issue is a problem, here and there. Maybe because myself never get any, so I do not understand the full scope of the problem. But still, it is so strange, yet so detrimental to society at large, because it threatens humanity as a whole, doing negative effects to our people. Maybe it is similar to what the Jovian had before, a cognitive brain mental issue, perhaps. Still, back to the topic, why it is so strange? For something like seizure, I can partially comprehend the cause of it. But for others with no clear of causation, it seems a little bit helpless to try to search through the Mental Health Manual (DSM-5-TR) because it feels, surreal and unknown. 

Might have something to do with patterns perhaps?
