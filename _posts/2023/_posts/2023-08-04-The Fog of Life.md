I'm sick of having no water. It seems like climate change (yeah I will call it that, but not a doomer, period) made the river and underground water source being unavailable to harvest.  Which is bad in its own sense, because a lot of things in our life use water...

### QOTD (Question of the day)

- AI seems to be over specialized. There seems to be a lot of different AI, with different design philosophy, different DNNs, and is not that well put together. As same for distribution system on computers, how can we make one for AI? What's the catch of all, and the general consensus idea?
- What is the dot product of both spherical and polar coordinates system? Sure it won't go the way of Cartesian coordinate, but it seems like there are no general case for the dot product. Vector product on the other hand is quite handy. 
- What is the role of religion in today's world? What is the basis of religion? What, in all sense, does god really mean? A hallucination, ancient escapism, or an imaginative entity of fraudulent?
- Suppose that I got a laser weapon. As it is, for a distance, the laser beam will be less effective as it widen out, decreasing the focus intensity of the beam. Thus means it got effective range and optimal range depends on, power of the source. How can I narrow that down? Specifically, are there any way to stop lasers from being widen out?
- Electrical waves oscillate in space. Gravitational waves oscillate in space. What is exactly that "space"?
- How to build an OS from scratch? What is the logic, the command, the structure, the components and most of all how all things communicate?
- How binary works in large scale, and at micro-scale?
- A fuzzy computer. Will that ever be feasible?
- What is the origin of quantum physics, and why there are so many "interpretations"? Is it because of the "uncertain" nature - which often correlate (personal opinion) to being probabilistic, non-deterministic of QP?
- How to deploy an app on AWS? (Seriously I need help helppp)

### TOTD (Thought of the day)

Quantum mechanics is weird - that is the general consensus of people interacted with quantum mechanics. There are so much rooms for interpretations, with Copenhagen Interpretation, then Many world interpretation, and so on. Why this is the case? If we look at the scale, we can see that, where is quantum physics? Microscopic scale. Under the microscopic lenses, we do not know everything. We know how many are there, the distribution, the perhaps quantitative information of it. But we do not know the exact details under such small scale with so many particles, interactions, and errors. We do not know where one's are, we know they are in there. We do not know their energy, we know the average, total energy of the isolated system. We do not know its direction, its spins, we do not know the history of interaction of every one of them. It simply we can't determine them enough. It becomes uncertainty in the measurement and identification of physical model and results under such scale. Thus, quantum physics takes a stance inside that, proposing different, tangible argument and theory for such task - to use probability of an uncertain, non-definite system. It is rather not as Einstein said "God does not play dices", but an answer "We do not know everything God do.". In quantum mechanics, precision of measurement is a thing, thus also the capability of define such. Generally, I think quantum mechanics is a step up from statistical mechanics. There are room for uncertainty. Current experimental capability and comprehension systems of physical models does not allow us to measure everything under the exact scale, so somewhat, we have to found a way. Quantum mechanics is what we often said "a beginning of a solution" that that specific question. But there are still errors, and someday, there might be another theory surpasses it. As for everything, we do not understand quantum mechanics, or what will lies ahead of it. We just have to find solution for the present, looking back from the past, and guess the future. 

Then, why people are afraid of quantum mechanics? Human psychology aside, which has a tendency of converging its conclusion into the security from the state of uncertain, to cling on a specific deterministic foundation, it is rather with the view of the world. We asset situation and knowledge, and, events based on our knowledge and experience. If suddenly everything become so foreign to your usually measured, defined, correct foundations and logic, it will make a head smoking like a barbeque in Sunday morning. Newtonian mechanics are deterministic, and exists in the scale of human - for once, it is called the Physics of Macro-world - the world human lives on.
