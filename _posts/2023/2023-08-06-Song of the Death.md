Today is a rather boring day. Seriously. It makes sense because it's Sunday, but I never know that it can be this much. Either way, it's nothing special other than buying new clothes, and study a bit of classical mechanics (somehow I hate Newtons now for those $F=m\frac{dv}{dt}$ jackshit). 

### QOTD (Question of the day)
- How can you create a QR code, from scratch? I mean adding QR code instantly, with more information inside incrementally. 
- I want to learn electrodynamics AHHHHHHH.
- Seriously though I want to design (probably) a nuclear reactor now. It is kind of interesting, doesn't it?
- Solar panels work with the principle of conversion between lights and electrical power. On one hand, you got photons. On the other, you have electrical powers. It seems like the efficiency is not very good, and solar panel is subjected to dusts and environmental changes. How can we potentially fix it?
- LASER is quite cool and good, but we have no available resource to pull it up. The outputting power is very small, far less than what we expected it to be, or we desired it to be. I think, we need to have some alloy or crystal for that. Also, the design for laser right now revolve around semi-enclosed, one-way photoelectric effects of an alloy or crystals, which is somehow not that effective. Wondering how can we improve it?
- Again, it seems like AI is not that well versed in tasks. Rather, it is too heavily specialized. I wonder what if I can make an simulation with a bunch of AI model with self-improvement in it...
- General relativity is not quite right. Why?

### TOTD (Thought of the day)

Nothing. For real. Except that constructor theory is quite... interesting. Take a note.
