Alright, here it comes. My graduation result. Quite a surprise if I do not get the perhaps particularly hopeful field that I found interesting, but hey, it's not that bad. Couple with games, new updates, new stuff, etc, it seems pretty fun for me as of today. 

Now, let's get this done so I can go for the God of RMT (yes, I'm serious)

### QOTD (Question of the Day)

- What is the correct representation of Einstein Theory of Relativity under the exact mathematical method for gravitational system? 
- Gravity ripples space-time. Then what is that space?
- Why it must be binary. For example, why logic is defined explicitly in terms of 1 (yes) and 0 (no)? While fuzzy logic does indeed do something with the concrete logical assumption throughout, but it seems variedly confusing that logic can be such. 
- Coriolis acceleration is an "artificial" acceleration, because it arises from the relational distance and peripheral description of location under different scope of identification. So how one can define such acceleration without falling into the pothole of "undeniable misrepresentation"? I also will question myself that my current assumption of Coriolis acceleration is a forced one. 
- Why functional programming has variables with immutability as a characteristic? In normal function, let say $f(x)=sin(x+2^{e})$, the function has indeed a variety of value it can takes from. What is the differences between variable bindings and variable assignments?
- How TV works, specifically OLED TV and Multilayer LCD-LED TV? It seems to me that there are the illumination setup (which contains around 24-28 small bulb which has very high luminosity), then two or three layer of alignments, and slits (perhaps). And then the main panel with colouring?
- How light is measured? Specifically, because the delay between any two points of measurement, there are falsification for any accuracy of measurement in terms of measuring exact lightspeed in experiments. One can also begs the question what is the way to somehow "slow down" the light by a fractions of its velocity then deduce the original, but then, what is actually happening here? 
- Why when lights move at any distance, assuming from little to unfathomable amount of resistance form environment, why it is spread out? Partially this is already answered, but the wave-particle duality of lights as any types of waves make it a little bit "unreal" in common sense, even thought it should be note that while we think "God does not play dice", one shall not assume what God do (yes, I'm going for Bohr vs Einstein here). Another thing is the fact that there are something to do with lights like particles, particularly, the phenomena of "bouncing off" the 'surface' of lights in interaction with particles. Or shall I assume absorption?

Forget the above (for real).
