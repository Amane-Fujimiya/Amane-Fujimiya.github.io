Well, hello there. It's another new year! And it's actually pretty decent for now. I hope nothing will happen this year around that can makes it worse... yeah.

Anyway, the mug is shown. This year around, I think I would have to work on for some bit of *theoretical physics*. Also, gotta do some of those lectures on Automata Theory, too.

## QOTD (Question of the day)
- In computer architecture, the famous theorem is that for every boolean function $B(\dots)\to \{ 0,1 \}$, it can be either represented by AND, NOT, or the set of AND, OR, NOT. In essence, and operational computational system, even though its problem of *minimal representation boolean* is NP-hard, in such finite system, there are finite components of which there everything can be represented. If so, would we want to find, for the "adaptive computer" called artificial intelligence, to have certainly those foundational, circuit-like components that either mathematically, or empirically proved that representation comes from those?

On the second thought, maybe that is not easy.
