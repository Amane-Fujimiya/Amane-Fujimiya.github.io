Hello...? Oh yes, it's working!

Hello! I'm Fujimiya Amane (藤宮天音), a physicist, researcher in Machine Learning, and mathematics. 

I created this site to well, gather knowledge if able, publish and holds my works later on, and well - for blogging purposes in the future perhaps. It's not too bad to gain a bit exposure, no? 

Most of the site is not complete as of now, so this might change for better or worse.
