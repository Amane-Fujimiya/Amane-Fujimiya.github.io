Hello...? Oh yes, it's working...

Hello! I'm Fujimiya Amane (藤宮天音), a physicist, researcher in Machine Learning, and mathematics. 

I created this site to well, gather knowledge if able, publish and holds my works later on, and well - for blogging purposes in the future, perhaps. It's not too bad to gain a bit of exposure, no? 

Here is my [email](mailto:fujimiyaamane@outlook.com), in which I am able to reply almost any time. 

## Info

>! The maintainer of this website is Bui Gia Khanh, a second-year undergraduate student of Hanoi University of Science, Vietnam National University. As of now, this site is actively maintained for the source available. So, yes, just about right.
